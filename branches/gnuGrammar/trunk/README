                             ABC: A C Front-end
                         http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/abc

ABC is a Java-based C front-end.  It provides a pre-processor and
parser for C programs.  These produce an Abstract Syntax Tree
representation of the program.  The AST includes information such as
the type of every expression, the "symbol table" (i.e., the mapping
which yields the entity corresponding to each identifier in the
program), and a precise description of the origin of each AST element
in the original source files.  There is also support for transforming
ASTs.  

The ABC interface is intended to be thoroughly documented and easy to
use.  The code is 100% Java.

No one is sure what ABC stands for.  It may stand for "ANTLR-Based C
front-end" because it uses the ANTLR parser generator at several
steps.  However, ABC goes significantly beyond the services provided
by these ANTLR parsers.  ABC may stand for "A Better C front-end" or
using it may be as easy as the "ABCs".

ABC is developed by Stephen F. Siegel and Timothy K. Zirkel at the
Verified Software Laboratory, University of Delaware.  It is

ABC is distributed as a jar file.  For most users, this is all you
