# All dependencies for the ABC project are defined here.

# Cobertura is a test coverage analysis tool for Java.
# Donwload from here: http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/download.html
# Unpack, place the directory somewhere, and set the directory path here: 
cobertura.lib.dir=/VSL/Tools/lib/cobertura

# JUnit is a well-known automated unit testing framework
# for Java.  Download the JUnit jar file from
# https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads
# All you need is the basic jar, e.g., "junit-4.10.jar".
# Set the path to it here:
junit.jar=/VSL/Tools/lib/junit.jar

# ANTLR is needed to build the parsers from the grammars,
# and in addition the runtime components are needed to
# compile and execute the ABC code. Best to just download
# the "complete" java binaries jar from 
# http://www.antlr.org/download.html
# and then set this path:
antlr.jar=/VSL/Tools/src/antlr/antlr-3.4/lib/antlr-3.4-complete.jar

# The ANTLR runtime library classes are incorporated into
# the final JAR of the ABC project (abc.jar).  While in theory
# those could be extracted from the complete ANTLR jar above,
# it is easier to just have a pointer to the runtime class files.
# I just downloaded the runtime-only source from the ANTLR site
# and compiled it into a separate directory.
# This directory should contain the "org" directory,
# whose subdirectories eventually contain all the .class files
# in the ANTLR runtime.
antlr.runtime.bin=/VSL/Tools/bin/antlr-3.4-runtime
