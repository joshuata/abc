                    ABC Installation Instructions

======================= Installation from source =======================

1. Install a Java 7 SDK if you have not already.  Go to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ for the
latest from Oracle.  On linux, you can optionally sudo apt-get install
openjdk-7-jdk.

2. Install Apache ant, if you don't already have it
(http://ant.apache.org).

3. Download dependent packages.
	a. If you are using 64-bit mac os, 64-bit linux or 32-bit linux, 
	   download the tgz archives from 
	   http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/tools/vsl_depend 
	   and unzip it some where on your system. 

	b. Otherwise, download the JUnit jar (v. 4.11), hamcrest-core jar (v. 1.3), 
	   ANTLR complete jar, and the ANTLR runtime and Jacoco gzipped tar archives 
	   from http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/tools. Put these files somewhere on your 
	   system and untar the ANTLR runtime and Jacoco archives.

4. svn checkout svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/abc

5. cd abc/trunk

6. Create a file named build.properties in the directory where build.xml is in.
	a. If you are using 64-bit mac os, 64-bit linux or 32-bit linux, 
	   copy and paste the content from 
	   properties/build.properties.osx. Edit the entry "root" to point to 
	   the corresponding directory that you download at step 3.a.
	
	b. Otherwise, copy and edit one of the examples in the properties directory. 
	   Edit each entry to point to the corresponding items you downloaded in step 3.b.

7. Type "ant" and everything should build without warnings or errors
and produce abc.jar.  Type "ant test" to run a JUnit test suite.  All
tests should pass.

If there are any problems, email siegel at udel dot edu.


============== Installation from source using Eclipse ==================

1. Start with Eclipse IDE for Java/EE developers, available at
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2. Do steps 1-3 from above if you have not already.

3. Install an SVN plugin in Eclipse (such as Subversive) if you have
not already.

4. From within Eclipse, select New Project...from SVN.  The archive is
svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/abc.  After entering that, open it up and
select the "trunk". (It is simplest to just check out the trunk for
the Eclipse project.)

5. Check out the trunk, and create the project using the New Java
Project Wizard as usual, naming it "ABC".  The .project, .classpath,
and other Eclipse meta-data are already in the SVN archive, saving you
a bunch of work.

6. Create the build.properties files as step 6 above. (This is not used
by Eclipse, but you will want to run Ant to build the jar file.)

7. Define Classpath variables.

	a. (Recommended) If you have put all dependent packages as Step 3.a above,
	   you only need to modify one classpath variables. Go to 
	   Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables, 
	   and edit the entry “VSL_DEPEND” to point to the directory 
	   where you put the dependent packages.
	
	b. Otherwise, navigate to Preferences->Java->Build
       Path->Classpath Variables->New and define a new variable called
       "ANTLR". To define it, navigate to and select the complete ANTLR jar
       file you downloaded above.  In addition, you may also define
       ANTLR_SOURCE to point to the root of the ANTLR source tree (this step
       is optional but helps with debugging).

8.  Do a clean build.  Everything should compile.  To build the jar,
right click (or ctrl-click on Mac) on build.xml and select
Run As->Ant Build.

9. To run the JUnit tests through Eclipse: Select Run->Run Configurations...
Create a new JUnit configuration called "ABC Tests".  Select
"Run all tests in the selected project..." and navigate to the "test"
folder in the ABC project.  Under the Arguments tab, type "-ea"
(without the quotes) into the VM arguments field, to enable assertion
checking.   Click "Run" to run the tests.
