                             ABC: A C Front-end

Installation from source:

0. Install Java 1.7 and Apache ant, if you don't have them already.

1. Download the JUnit jar (v. 4.10), ANTLR complete jar, and the ANTLR runtime 
and Jacoco gzipped tar archives from http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/tools.  Put these 
files somewhere on your system and untar the ANTLR runtime and Jacoco archives.

2. svn checkout svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/abc

3. cd abc/trunk

4. Create a file named build.properties by copying and editing one of the examples
in the properties directory.  Edit each entry to point to the corresponding items
you downloaded in step 1.

5. Type "ant" and everything should build without warnings or errors and produce
abc.jar.  Type "ant test" to run a JUnit test suite.  All tests should pass.

If there are any problems, email siegel at udel dot edu.

Installation from source using Eclipse:

1. Do steps 0 and 1 from above if you have not already.

2. Install an SVN plugin in Eclipse (such as Subversive) if you have not already.

3. From within Eclipse, select New Project...from SVN.  The archive
is svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/abc.  After entering that, open it up and select
the "trunk". (It is simplest to just check out the trunk for the Eclipse
project.)

4. Check out the trunk, and create the project using the New Java Project
Wizard as usual, naming it "ABC".  The .project, .classpath,  and other Eclipse
meta-data are already in the SVN archive, saving you a bunch of work.

5. The platform-specific information are handled
in Eclipse by defining Classpath variables.  Navigate to  
Preferences->Java->Build Path-> Classpath Variables->New
and define a new variable called "ANTLR". To define it,
navigate to and select the complete ANTLR jar file you downloaded
above.  In addition, you may also define ANTLR_SOURCE to point
to the root of the ANTLR source tree, but that is optional.
