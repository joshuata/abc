/**
 * Represents an array type. See C11 Sec. 6.7.6.2.
 * 
 * Note that in certain contexts type qualifiers may also occur between the
 * square brackets in the array type designation. These will be determined by
 * calling the appropriate qualifier methods in TypeNode.
 * 
 * An array type is an object type specified by an element type and the extent.
 * The element type must be a complete object type. For the extent, there are 4
 * possibilities:
 * 
 * NOTE: the keyword "static" can only appear in the outermost part of the
 * declaration of a function parameter, and since the types are converted to
 * pointer, "static" does not ultimately occur in an array type. On the other
 * hand "*" can occur in any number of internal array types in a function
 * parameter, so it can ultimately be part of an array type.
 * 
 * (0) the extent is not specified (i.e., is null): then the array type is an
 * "incomplete type".
 * 
 * (1) the extent is "*": this is a "VLA type of unspecified size". It is
 * nevertheless a complete type. This can only be used in declarations or type
 * names in function prototype scope (i.e., in a function declaration that is
 * not part of a function definition).
 * 
 * (2) the extent is an integer constant expression AND the element type has
 * known constant size: then the array type is "not a VLA" type. It is complete.
 * (Note: an object type has "known constant size" iff it is not incomplete AND
 * not a VLA (Variable Length Array) type.)
 * 
 * (3) otherwise, the extent is an expression which is not a constant
 * expression. This is a VLA type. It is complete. If it occurs in function
 * prototype scope, it is treated as if it were "*" (i.e., the expression is not
 * used).
