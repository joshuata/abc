/**
 * A character stream that wraps another "original" character stream but removes
 * all occurrences of backslash followed by newline. This is to handle Phase 2
 * of the C translation process.
 * 
 * If a stream has n elements, numbered from 0 to n-1, the stream has n+1 cursor
 * positions, numbered 0 to n. Think of curson position i as just before element
 * i, and cursor position n as just after the last element.
 * 
 * A call to LA(1) should return the character just after the cursor. In other
 * words, if the cursor is at position p, then LA(1) should return element p. If
 * the cursor is at position n, LA(1) should return CharStream.EOF.
 * 
 * The cursor in the original stream will never rest just before a
 * backslash-newline. It will always be progressed after such a point. That
 * means a call to original.LA(1) should return the real next char.
