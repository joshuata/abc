/**
 * The purpose of this class is to perform Translation Phases 5 and 6. Phase 5
 * begins just after all preprocessing directives have been executed. From C11
 * Sec. 5.1.1.2:
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 * <ul>
 * <li>5. Each source character set member and escape sequence in character
 * constants and string literals is converted to the corresponding member of the
 * execution character set; if there is no corresponding member, it is converted
 * to an implementation- defined member other than the null (wide) character.8)</li>
 * <li>6. Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * Need special character token and string token.  Special structure.
 * Basically what is in value.
 * 
 * Also need to append '\0' character to string literals in Phase 7.
 * 
 * make this its own component
